# Movie Data Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib
ðŸŽ¬ This project involves analyzing movie data and ratings using Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The goal is to explore the movie dataset, uncover insights, and present the findings using various graphs and charts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the movie data CSV files:
   - movies.csv
   - rating.csv
3. Update the file paths in the script to match the location of the CSV files on your system.

## Features

### Genre Analysis

- Analyze the distribution of movie genres using a pie chart.
- Gain insights into the popularity of different genres in the dataset.

### Movie Popularity Over Time

- Calculate and visualize the average rating of movies over the years.
- Observe the trend of movie popularity across different release years.

### Movie Genre Popularity Over Time

- Create a heatmap to display the popularity of different movie genres over the years.
- Understand how certain genres have gained or lost popularity over time.

### Movie Budget and Revenue Comparison

- Compare budgets and revenues of the top 10 revenue movies using scatter plots.
- Visualize the correlation between budget and revenue, potentially with a bubble chart.

### Movie Length Analysis

- Analyze the distribution of movie lengths using a box plot.
- Understand the spread of movie lengths and identify outliers.

### Top-Rated Movies

- Identify the top-rated movies based on average ratings.
- Present the top-rated movies using a horizontal bar chart.

### User Ratings by Age Group

- Calculate and visualize the mean rating given by different age groups.
- Gain insights into how age influences movie ratings.

### Movie Ratings Distribution

- Plot a histogram to display the distribution of movie ratings.
- Understand the frequency distribution of ratings given by users.

## Usage

Run the script to perform the movie data analysis and generate visualizations based on the provided CSV files. Make sure to have the required Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib) installed.

```bash
python main.py
```
